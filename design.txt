Prompt:
Quiz Maker
Make an application which takes various questions from a file, picked randomly, and puts together a quiz for students.
Each quiz can be different and then reads a key to grade the quizzes.

Many questions need to be answered, and many assumptions need to be made, after reading the prompt above.
I will start stating the assumptions that I will base my design on.


Objective:
Eventually the application should be able to handle mutiple styles of file input that will contain the set of questions and answers, which will make up the quiz. By styles I mean formats like JSON, XML, delimited-text, etc. To start I think I'm going to use delimited-text because I won't need to consume any external libraries for reading JSON/XML.

User input will be:
- File containing the questions
- The number of questions that the quiz should be made up of
- (Optional) How many of the multiple choice answers should be made available (so if the file contains 6 answer options, only 1 being correct, should we limit that number to say 3 options)

Ex question file:
How many periods are in the following sentence? "Programming is fun. Programming can be hard, but designing is harder." | 3 | Two | One | Three
People will likely use this application! (Choose the most correct) | 3 | Probably not | True | False

The above example file will generate up to two questions. The format of our delimited line is:
<Question> | <Number of answers> | <Correct answer> [ | <Incorrect answer> ]*
I'm not sure I need the <Number of answers> input but to make things easy I added it.

Output will be:
- Answer key for the quiz
- The quiz

Limitations:
- Given that I need to generate an answer key, there will be no short/long answer questions and thus only be multiple choice questions to be used in the quiz.
- Additionally there will only ever be 1 correct answer, so we won't have a "Select all that apply" option.

Future:
On top of the quiz maker, I imagine this tool should be able to produce an outcome sheet given an answer key and one, or more, completed quizes (set of answers).
The two limitations explained above could probably be fixed as a future project, but I'm going to keep the scope of the project small for now.
